\chapter{Shell scripts}
\label{script}

\index{script}
It is often convenient to simply write what one wants
done into a file or {\em script}, and execute the
script as though it were any other operating-system
shell command.  The interface to more weighty programs
is often provided in the form of a script, and users
frequently build their own scripts or customize
existing ones to suit particular needs.  Scripting is
arguably the most frequent programming task performed.
For many users, it is the only programming they will
ever do.

Operating systems such as Unix and DOS (the
command-line interface provided in Windows)
provide such a scripting mechanism, but the scripting
language in both cases is very rudimentary.  Often a
script is just a sequence or {\em batch} of commands
that one would type to the shell prompt.  It saves the
user from having to type every one of the shell
commands individually each time they require the same
or similar sequence to be performed.  Some scripting
languages throw in a small amount of programmability in
the form of a conditional and a loop, but that is about
all.  This is enough for smallish tasks, but as one’s
scripts become bigger and more demanding, as scripts
invariably seem to do, one often feels the need for a
fuller fledged programming language.  A Scheme with an
adequate operating-system interface makes scripting
easy and maintainable.

This section will describe how to write scripts in
Scheme.  Since there is wide variation in the various
Scheme dialects on how to accomplish this, we will
concentrate on the MzScheme dialect, and document in
appendix~\ref{dialect} the modifications needed for
other dialects.  We will also concentrate on the Unix
operating system for the moment; appendix~\ref{dos}
will deal with the DOS counterpart.

\section{Hello, World!, again}

We will now create a Scheme script that says hello to
the world.  Saying hello is of course not a demanding
scripting problem for traditional scripting languages.
However, understanding how to transcribe it into Scheme
will launch us on the path to more ambitious scripts.
First, a conventional Unix hello script is a file, with
contents that look like:

\p{
echo Hello, World!
}

\n It uses the shell command \p{echo}.  The script can be
named \p{hello}, made into an executable by doing

\p{
chmod +x hello
}

\n and placed in one of
the directories named in the \p{PATH} environment
variable.  Thereafter, anytime one types

\p{
hello
}

\n at the shell  prompt, one promptly gets the
insufferable greeting.

A Scheme hello script will perform the same output
using Scheme (using the program in chapter~\ref{hello}),
but we need something in the file to inform the
operating system that it needs to construe the commands
in the file as Scheme, and not as its default script
language.  The Scheme script file, also called
\p{hello}, looks like:

\p{
":"; exec mzscheme -r $0 "$@"

(display "Hello, World!")
(newline))
}

\n Everything following the first line is straight
Scheme.  However, the first line is the magic that
makes this into a script.  When the user types
\p{hello} at the Unix prompt, Unix will read the file
as a regular script.  The first thing it sees is the
\p{":"}, which is a shell no-op.  The \p{;} is the shell
command separator.  The next shell command is the
\p{exec}.  \p{exec} tells Unix to abandon  the
current script and run \p{mzscheme -r $0 "$@"} instead,
where the parameter \p{$0} will be replaced by the name
of the script, and the parameter \p{"$@"} will be
replaced by the list of arguments given by the user to
the script.  (In this case, there are no such
arguments.)

We have now, in effect, transformed the \p{hello} shell
command into a different shell command, viz.,

\p{
mzscheme -r /whereveritis/hello
}

\n where \p{/whereveritis/hello} is the pathname of \p{hello}.

\p{mzscheme} calls the MzScheme executable.  The \p{-r}
option tells it to load the immediately following
argument as a Scheme file after collecting any
succeeding arguments into a vector called \q{argv}.
(In this example, \q{argv} will be the null vector.)

Thus, the Scheme script will be run as a Scheme file,
and the Scheme forms in the file will have access to
the script’s original arguments via the vector
\q{argv}.

Now, Scheme has to tackle the first line in the script,
which as we’ve already seen, was really a well-formed,
{\em traditional} shell script.  The \q{":"} is a
self-evaluating string in Scheme and thus harmless.
The
‘\p{;}’ marks a Scheme comment, and so the \p{exec ...} is
safely ignored.  The rest of the file is of course
straight Scheme, and the expressions therein are
evaluated in sequence.  After all of them have been
evaluated, Scheme will exit.

In sum, typing \p{hello} at the shell prompt will produce

\p{
Hello, World!
}

\n and return you to the shell prompt.

\section{Scripts with arguments}

A Scheme script uses the variable \q{argv} to refer to
its arguments.  For example, the following script
echoes all its arguments, each on a line:

\q{
":"; exec mzscheme -r $0 "$@"

;Put in argv-count the number of arguments supplied

(define argv-count (vector-length argv))

(let loop ((i 0))
  (unless (>= i argv-count)
    (display (vector-ref argv i))
    (newline)
    (loop (+ i 1))))
}

Let’s call this script \p{echoall}.  Calling \p{echoall
1 2 3} will display

\p{
1
2
3
}

\n Note that the script name (\q{"echoall"}) is {\em not} included in
the argument vector.

\section{Example}

Let’s now tackle a more substantial problem.  We need
to transfer files from one computer to another and the
only method we have is to use a 3.5'' floppy as a
ferry.  We need a script \p{split4floppy} that will
split files larger than 1.44 million bytes into
floppy-sized chunks.  The script file \p{split4floppy}
is as follows:

\q{
":";exec mzscheme -r $0 "$@"

;floppy-size = number of bytes that will comfortably fit on a
;              3.5" floppy

(define floppy-size 1440000)

;split splits the bigfile f into the smaller, floppy-sized
;subfiles, viz., subfile-prefix.1, subfile-prefix.2, etc.

(define split
  (lambda (f subfile-prefix)
    (call-with-input-file f
      (lambda (i)
        (let loop ((n 1))
          (if (copy-to-floppy-sized-subfile i subfile-prefix n)
              (loop (+ n 1))))))))

;copy-to-floppy-sized-subfile copies the next 1.44 million
;bytes (if there are less than that many bytes left, it
;copies all of them) from the big file to the nth
;subfile.  Returns true if there are bytes left over,
;otherwise returns false.

(define copy-to-floppy-sized-subfile
  (lambda (i subfile-prefix n)
    (let ((nth-subfile (string-append subfile-prefix "."
                                      (number->string n))))
      (if (file-exists? nth-subfile) (delete-file nth-subfile))
      (call-with-output-file nth-subfile
        (lambda (o)
          (let loop ((k 1))
            (let ((c (read-char i)))
              (cond ((eof-object? c) #f)
                    (else
                     (write-char c o)
                     (if (< k floppy-size)
                         (loop (+ k 1))
                         #t))))))))))

;bigfile = script’s first arg
;        = the file that needs splitting

(define bigfile (vector-ref argv 0))

;subfile-prefix = script’s second arg
;               = the basename of the subfiles

(define subfile-prefix (vector-ref argv 1))

;Call split, making subfile-prefix.{1,2,3,...} from
;bigfile

(split bigfile subfile-prefix)
}

\n Script \p{split4floppy} is called as follows:

\p{
split4floppy largefile chunk
}

\n This splits \p{largefile} into subfiles \p{chunk.1},
\p{chunk.2}, ..., such that each subfile fits on a
floppy.

After the \p{chunk.i} have been ferried over to the
target computer, the file \p{largefile} can be
retrieved by stringing the \p{chunk.i} together.  This
can be  done on Unix with:

\p{
cat chunk.1 chunk.2 ... > largefile
}

\n and on DOS with:

\p{
copy /b chunk.1+chunk.2+... largefile
}
