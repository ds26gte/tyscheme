\chapter{Structures}

\index{structure}
Data that are naturally grouped are called {\em
structures}.  One can use Scheme’s compound data types,
e.g., vectors or lists, to represent structures.  E.g.,
let’s say we are dealing with grouped data relevant to
a (botanical) {\em tree}.  The individual elements of
the data, or {\em fields}, could be: {\em height}, {\em
girth}, {\em age}, {\em leaf-shape}, and {\em
leaf-color}, making a total of 5 fields.  Such data
could be represented as a 5-element vector.  The fields
could be accessed using
\q{vector-ref} and modified using \q{vector-set!}.
Nevertheless, we wouldn’t want to be saddled with the
burden of remembering which vector index corresponds to
which field.  That would be a thankless and error-prone
activity, especially if fields get excluded or included
over the course of time.

\index{defstruct@\q{defstruct}}
\index{structure!defstruct@\q{defstruct}}

We will therefore use a Scheme macro \q{defstruct} to
define a structure data type, which is basically a
vector, but which comes with an appropriate suite of
procedures for creating instances of the structure, and
for accessing and modifying its fields.  Thus, our \q{tree}
structure could be defined as:

\q{
(defstruct tree height girth age leaf-shape leaf-color)
}

This gives us a constructor procedure named
\q{make-tree}; accessor procedures for each field,
named
\q{tree.height}, \q{tree.girth}, etc; and modifier
procedures for each field, named \q{set!tree.height},
\q{set!tree.girth}, etc.  The constructor is used as
follows:

\q{
(define coconut 
  (make-tree 'height 30
             'leaf-shape 'frond
             'age 5))
}

\n The constructor’s arguments are in the form of
twosomes, a field name followed by its initialization.
The fields can occur in any order, and may even be
missing, in which case their value is undefined.

The accessor procedures are invoked as follows:

\q{
(tree.height coconut) |evalsto 30
(tree.leaf-shape coconut) |evalsto frond
(tree.girth coconut) |evalsto <undefined>
}

\n The \q{tree.girth} accessor returns an undefined value,
because we did not specify \q{girth} for the
\q{coconut} \q{tree}.

The modifier procedures are invoked as follows:

\q{
(set!tree.height coconut 40)
(set!tree.girth coconut 10)
}

If we now access these fields using the corresponding
accessors, we will get the new values:

\q{
(tree.height coconut) |evalsto 40
(tree.girth coconut) |evalsto 10
}

\section{Default initializations}

We can have some initializations done during the
definition of the structure itself, instead of per
instance.  Thus, we could postulate that \q{leaf-shape}
and \q{leaf-color} are by default \q{frond} and
\q{green} respectively.  We can always override these
defaults by providing explicit initialization in the
\q{make-tree} call, or by
using a field modifier after the structure instance has
been created:

\q{
(defstruct tree height girth age
                (leaf-shape 'frond)
                (leaf-color 'green))

(define palm (make-tree 'height 60))

(tree.height palm) 
|evalsto 60

(tree.leaf-shape palm) 
|evalsto frond

(define plantain 
  (make-tree 'height 7
             'leaf-shape 'sheet))

(tree.height plantain) 
|evalsto 7

(tree.leaf-shape plantain) 
|evalsto sheet

(tree.leaf-color plantain) 
|evalsto green
}

\section{\q{defstruct} defined}

The \q{defstruct} macro definition follows:

\scmfilename defstruct.scm

\scmwrite&
;(defstruct structname [field | (field default-value)] ...)
;
;creates
;the constructor make-structname
;the predicate structname?
;the accessors structname.field (for each field)
;the setters set!structname.field (for each field)
;
;make-structname can take {field init-value} arguments,
;in which it case it sets field to init-value.  Otherwise,
;it sets field to default-value, if such was provided in
;the defstruct call
