\chapter{Lexical variables}

\index{variable!lexical}
\index{variable!local}
\index{variable!global}
Scheme’s variables have lexical scope, i.e., they are
visible only to forms within a certain contiguous
stretch of program text.  The {\em global} variables we
have seen thus far are no exception: Their scope is all
program text, which is certainly contiguous.

We have also seen some examples of {\em local}
variables.  These were the \q{lambda} parameters, which
get {\em bound} each time the procedure is called, and
whose scope is that procedure’s body.  E.g.,

\q{
(define x 9)
(define add2 (lambda (x) (+ x 2)))

x        |evalsto 9

(add2 3) |evalsto 5
(add2 x) |evalsto 11

x        |evalsto 9
}

Here, there is a global \q{x}, and there is also a
local \q{x}, the latter introduced by procedure
\q{add2}.  The global \q{x} is always
\q{9}.  The local \q{x} gets bound to \q{3} in the
first call to \q{add2} and to the value of the global
\q{x}, i.e., \q{9}, in the second call to \q{add2}.
When the procedure calls return, the global \q{x}
continues to be \q{9}.

The form \q{set!} modifies the lexical binding of a
variable.

\q{
(set! x 20)
}

\n modifies the global binding of \q{x} from \q{9} to
\q{20}, because that is the binding of \q{x} that is
visible to \q{set!}.  If the \q{set!} was inside
\q{add2}’s body, it would have modified the local
\q{x}:

\q{
(define add2
  (lambda (x)
    (set! x (+ x 2))
    x))
}

The \q{set!} here adds \q{2} to the local variable
\q{x}, and the procedure returns this new value of the local \q{x}.  (In terms of effect,
this procedure is indistinguishable from the previous
\q{add2}.)  We can call \q{add2} on the
global \q{x}, as before:

\q{
(add2 x) |evalsto 22
}

\n (Remember global \q{x} is now \q{20}, not \q{9}!)

The \q{set!} inside \q{add2} affects only the local
variable used by \q{add2}.  Although the local variable
\q{x} got its  binding from the global \q{x},
the latter is unaffected by the \q{set!} to the local
\q{x}.

\q{
x |evalsto 20
}

Note that we had all this discussion because we used
the same identifier for a local variable and a global
variable.  In any text, an identifier named \q{x} refers
to the lexically closest variable named \q{x}.  This
will {\em shadow} any outer or global \q{x}’s.  E.g.,
in \q{add2}, the parameter \q{x} shadows the global
\q{x}.

A procedure’s body can access and modify variables in
its surrounding scope provided the procedure’s
parameters don’t shadow them.  This can give some
interesting programs.  E.g.,

\q{
(define counter 0)

(define bump-counter
  (lambda ()
    (set! counter (+ counter 1))
    counter))
}

The procedure \q{bump-counter} is a zero-argument
procedure (also called a {\em thunk}).  It introduces
no local variables, and thus cannot shadow anything.
Each time it is called, it modifies the {\em global}
variable
\q{counter} — it increments it by 1 — and returns
its current value.  Here are some successive calls to
\q{bump-counter}:

\q{
(bump-counter) |evalsto 1
(bump-counter) |evalsto 2
(bump-counter) |evalsto 3
}

\section{\q{let} and \q{let*}}

Local variables can be introduced without explicitly
creating a procedure.  The special form \q{let}
introduces a list of local variables for use within its
body:

\q{
(let ((x 1)
      (y 2)
      (z 3))
  (list x y z))
|evalsto (1 2 3)
}

\n As with \q{lambda}, within the \q{let}-body, the local
\q{x} (bound to \q{1}) shadows the global \q{x} (which
is bound to \q{20}).

The local variable initializations — \q{x} to \q{1};
\q{y} to \q{2}; \q{z} to \q{3} — are not considered
part of the \q{let} body.  Therefore, a reference to
\q{x} in the initialization will refer to the global,
not the local \q{x}:

\q{
(let ((x 1)
      (y x))
  (+ x y))
|evalsto 21
}

\n This is because \q{x} is bound to \q{1}, and \q{y} is
bound to the {\em global} \q{x}, which is \q{20}.

Sometimes, it is convenient to have \q{let}’s list of
lexical variables be introduced in sequence, so that
the initialization of a later variable occurs in the
{\em lexical scope} of earlier variables.   The form
\q{let*} does this:

\q{
(let* ((x 1)
       (y x))
  (+ x y))
|evalsto 2
}

\n The \q{x} in \q{y}’s initialization refers to the \q{x}
just above.  The example is entirely equivalent to —
and is in fact intended to be a convenient abbreviation
for — the following program with nested \q{let}s:

\q{
(let ((x 1))
  (let ((y x))
    (+ x y)))
|evalsto 2
}

The values bound to lexical variables can be
procedures:

\q{
(let ((cons (lambda (x y) (+ x y))))
  (cons 1 2))
|evalsto 3
}

\n Inside this \q{let} body, the lexical variable \q{cons}
adds its arguments.   Outside, \q{cons} continues to
create dotted pairs.

\section{\q{fluid-let}}
\label{fluid-let}

A lexical variable is visible throughout its scope,
provided it isn’t shadowed.  Sometimes, it is helpful
to {\em temporarily} set a lexical variable to a
certain value.  For this, we use the form
\q{fluid-let}.\f{\q{fluid-let} is a nonstandard special
form.  See section~\ref{fluid-let-macro} for a definition
of \q{fluid-let} in Scheme.}

\q{
(fluid-let ((counter 99))
  (display (bump-counter)) (newline)
  (display (bump-counter)) (newline)
  (display (bump-counter)) (newline))
}

\n
This looks similar to a \q{let}, but instead of
shadowing the global variable \q{counter}, it
temporarily sets it to \q{99} before continuing with
the
\q{fluid-let} body.  Thus the \q{display}s in the body
produce

\p{
100
101
102
}

\n After the \q{fluid-let} expression has evaluated,
the global \q{counter} reverts to the value it had
before the \q{fluid-let}.

\q{
counter |evalsto 3
}

Note that \q{fluid-let} has an entirely different
effect from \q{let}.  \q{fluid-let} does not introduce
new lexical variables like \q{let} does.  It modifies
the bindings of {\em existing} lexical variables, and
the modification ceases as soon as the \q{fluid-let} does.

To drive home this point, consider the program

\q{
(let ((counter 99))
  (display (bump-counter)) (newline)
  (display (bump-counter)) (newline)
  (display (bump-counter)) (newline))
}

\n which substitutes \q{let} for \q{fluid-let} in
the previous example.  The output is now

\q{
4
5
6
}

\n I.e., the global \q{counter}, which is initially
\q{3}, is updated by each call to \q{bump-counter}.
The new lexical variable \q{counter}, with its
initialization of \q{99}, has no impact on the calls to
\q{bump-counter}, because although the calls to
\q{bump-counter} are within the scope of this local
\q{counter}, the body of \q{bump-counter} isn’t.  The
latter continues to refer to the {\em global}
\q{counter}, whose final value is \q{6}.

\q{
counter |evalsto 6
}
