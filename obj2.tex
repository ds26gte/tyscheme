\section{Classes are instances too}

\index{metaclass}
It cannot have escaped the astute reader that classes
themselves look like they could be the instances of
some class (a {\em metaclass}, if you will).  Note that
all classes have some common behavior: each of them has
slots, a superclass, a list of method names, and a
method vector.  \q{make-instance} looks like it could
be their shared method.  This suggests that we could
specify this common behavior by another class (which
itself should, of course, be a class instance too).

In concrete terms, we could rewrite our class
implementation to itself make use of the
object-oriented approach, provided we make sure we
donâ€™t run into chicken-and-egg problems.  In effect, we
will be getting rid of the \q{class} struct and its
attendant procedures and rely on the rest of the
machinery to define classes as objects.

Let us identify \q{standard-class} as the class of
which other classes are instances of.  In particular,
\q{standard-class} must be an instance of itself.  What
should \q{standard-class} look like?

We know \q{standard-class} is an instance, and we are
representing instances by vectors.  So it is a
vector whose first element holds its class, i.e.,
itself, and whose remaining elements are slot values.
We have identified four slots that all classes must
have, so \q{standard-class} is a 5-element vector.

\scmdribble{
(define standard-class
  (vector 'value-of-standard-class-goes-here
          (list 'slots
                'superclass
                'method-names
                'method-vector)
          #t
          '(make-instance)
          (vector make-instance)))
}

\n Note that the \q{standard-class} vector is
incompletely filled in: the symbol
\q{value-of-standard-class-goes-here} functions as a
placeholder.  Now that we have defined a
\q{standard-class} value, we can use it to identify its
own class, which is itself:

\scmdribble{
(vector-set! standard-class 0 standard-class)
}

Note that we cannot rely on procedures based on the
\q{class} struct anymore.  We should replace all calls
of the form

\q{
(standard-class? x)
(standard-class.slots c)
(standard-class.superclass c)
(standard-class.method-names c)
(standard-class.method-vector c)
(make-standard-class ...)
}

\n by

\q{
(and (vector? x) (eqv? (vector-ref x 0) standard-class))
(vector-ref c 1)
(vector-ref c 2)
(vector-ref c 3)
(vector-ref c 4)
(send 'make-instance standard-class ...)
}

\scmwrite{
(define (standard-class? x)
  (and (vector? x) (eqv? (vector-ref x 0) standard-class)))
(define (standard-class.slots c) (vector-ref c 1))
(define (standard-class.superclass c) (vector-ref c 2))
(define (standard-class.method-names c) (vector-ref c 3))
(define (standard-class.method-vector c) (vector-ref c 4))
(define (make-standard-class . args) 
  (apply send 'make-instance standard-class args))
}
