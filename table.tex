\chapter{Alists and tables}

\index{alist}
An {\em association list}, or {\em alist}, is a Scheme
list of a special format.  Each element of the list is
a cons cell, the car of which is called a {\em key},
the cdr being the {\em value} associated with the key.
E.g.,

\q{
((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3))
}

\index{assv@\q{assv}}

The procedure call \q{(assv k al)} finds the cons cell
associated with key \q{k} in alist \q{al}.  The keys of
the alist are compared against the given \q{k} using
the equality predicate \q{eqv?}.  In general, though we
may want a different predicate for key comparison.  For
instance, if the keys were case-insensitive strings,
the predicate \q{eqv?} is not very useful.

\index{table}

We now define a structure called \q{table}, which is a
souped-up alist that allows user-defined predicates on
its keys.  Its fields are \q{equ} and \q{alist}.

\scmfilename table.scm

\scmwrite{
(load-relative "defstruct.scm")
}

\scmdribble{
(defstruct table (equ eqv?) (alist '()))
}

\n (The default predicate is \q{eqv?} — as for an
ordinary alist — and the alist is initially empty.)

We will use the procedure \q{table-get} to get the
value (as opposed to the cons cell) associated with a
given key.  \q{table-get} takes a table and key
arguments, followed by an optional default value that
is returned if the key was not found in the table:

\scmdribble{
(define table-get
  (lambda (tbl k . d)
    (let ((c (lassoc k (table.alist tbl) (table.equ tbl))))
      (cond (c (cdr c))
            ((pair? d) (car d))))))
}

The procedure \q{lassoc}, used in \q{table-get}, is
defined as:

\scmdribble{
(define lassoc
  (lambda (k al equ?)
    (let loop ((al al))
      (if (null? al) #f
          (let ((c (car al)))
            (if (equ? (car c) k) c
                (loop (cdr al))))))))
}

The procedure \q{table-put!} is used to update a key’s
value in the given table:

\scmdribble{
(define table-put!
  (lambda (tbl k v)
    (let ((al (table.alist tbl)))
      (let ((c (lassoc k al (table.equ tbl))))
        (if c (set-cdr! c v)
            (set!table.alist tbl (cons (cons k v) al)))))))
}

The procedure \q{table-for-each} calls the given
procedure on every key/value pair in the table

\scmdribble{
(define table-for-each
  (lambda (tbl p)
    (for-each
     (lambda (c)
       (p (car c) (cdr c)))
     (table.alist tbl))))
}
