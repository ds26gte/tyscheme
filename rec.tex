A procedure body can contain calls to other procedures,
not least itself:

\q{
(define factorial
  (lambda (n)
    (if (= n 0) 1
        (* n (factorial (- n 1))))))
}

\n This {\em recursive} procedure calculates the {\em
factorial} of a number.  If the number is \q{0}, the
answer is \q{1}.  For any other number \q{n}, the
procedure uses itself to calculate the factorial of
\q{n - 1}, multiplies that subresult by \q{n}, and
returns the product.

Mutually recursive procedures are also possible.  The
following predicates for evenness and oddness use each
other:

\q{
(define is-even?
  (lambda (n)
    (if (= n 0) #t
        (is-odd? (- n 1)))))

(define is-odd?
  (lambda (n)
    (if (= n 0) #f
        (is-even? (- n 1)))))
}

\index{even?@\q{even?}}
\index{odd?@\q{odd?}}

These definitions are offered here only as simple
illustrations of mutual recursion.  Scheme already
provides the primitive predicates \q{even?} and
\q{odd?}.

\section{\q{letrec}}

If we wanted the above procedures as local
variables, we could try to use a \q{let} form:

\q{
(let ((local-even? (lambda (n)
                     (if (= n 0) #t
                         (local-odd? (- n 1)))))
      (local-odd? (lambda (n)
                    (if (= n 0) #f
                        (local-even? (- n 1))))))
  (list (local-even? 23) (local-odd? 23)))
}

\n This won’t quite work, because the occurrences of
\q{local-even?} and \q{local-odd?} in the initializations
don’t refer to the lexical variables themselves.
Changing the \q{let} to a \q{let*} won’t work either,
for while the \q{local-even?} inside \q{local-odd?}’s body
refers to the correct procedure value, the \q{local-odd?}
in \q{local-even?}’s body still points elsewhere.

To solve problems like this, Scheme provides the form
\q{letrec}:

\q{
(letrec ((local-even? (lambda (n)
                        (if (= n 0) #t
                            (local-odd? (- n 1)))))
         (local-odd? (lambda (n)
                       (if (= n 0) #f
                           (local-even? (- n 1))))))
  (list (local-even? 23) (local-odd? 23)))
}

\n The lexical variables introduced by a \q{letrec} are
visible not only in the \q{letrec}-body but also within
all the initializations.  \q{letrec} is thus
tailor-made for defining recursive and mutually
recursive local procedures.

\section{Named \q{let}}

A recursive procedure defined using \q{letrec} can
describe loops.  Let’s say we want to display a
countdown from \q{10}:

\q{
(letrec ((countdown (lambda (i)
                      (if (= i 0) 'liftoff
                          (begin
                            (display i)
                            (newline)
                            (countdown (- i 1)))))))
  (countdown 10))
}

\n This outputs on the console the numbers \q{10} down to
\q{1}, and returns the result \q{liftoff}.

Scheme allows a variant of \q{let} called {\em named}
\q{let} to write this kind of loop more compactly:

\q{
(let countdown ((i 10))
  (if (= i 0) 'liftoff
      (begin
        (display i)
        (newline)
        (countdown (- i 1)))))
}

\n Note the presence of a variable identifying the loop
immediately after the \q{let}.  This program is
equivalent to the one written with \q{letrec}.  You may
consider the named \q{let} to be a macro
(chapter~\ref{sugar}) expanding to the \q{letrec} form.

\section{Iteration}

\q{countdown} defined above is really a recursive
procedure.  Scheme can define loops only through
recursion.  There are no special looping or iteration
constructs.

Nevertheless, the loop as defined above is a {\em
genuine} loop, in exactly the same way that other
languages bill their loops.  I.e., Scheme takes special
care to ensure that recursion of the type used above
will not generate the procedure call/return overhead.

Scheme does this by a process called {\em tail-call
elimination}.  If you look closely at the \q{countdown}
procedure, you will note that when the recursive call
occurs in \q{countdown}’s body, it is the {\em tail call},
or the very last thing done — each invocation of
\q{countdown} either does not call itself, or when it
does, it does so as its very last act.  To a Scheme
implementation, this makes the recursion
indistinguishable from iteration.  So go ahead, use
recursion to write loops.  It’s safe.

Here’s another example of a useful tail-recursive
procedure:

\index{list-position@\q{list-position}}
\scmfilename listpos.scm
\scmdribble{
(define list-position
  (lambda (o l)
    (let loop ((i 0) (l l))
      (if (null? l) #f
          (if (eqv? (car l) o) i
              (loop (+ i 1) (cdr l)))))))
}

\n \q{list-position} finds the index of the first
occurrence of the object \q{o} in the list \q{l}.  If
the object is not found in the list, the procedure
returns \q{#f}.

Here’s yet another tail-recursive procedure, one that
reverses its argument list “in place”, i.e., by mutating
the contents of the existing list, and without
allocating a new one:

\index{reverse"!@\q{reverse"!}}
\scmfilename reverseb.scm
\scmdribble{
(define reverse!
  (lambda (s)
    (let loop ((s s) (r '()))
      (if (null? s) r
	  (let ((d (cdr s)))
            (set-cdr! s r)
	    (loop d s))))))
}

\n
(\q{reverse!} is a useful enough procedure that it is
provided primitively in many Scheme dialects, e.g.,
MzScheme and Guile.)

\index{Monte Carlo simulation}
In the last chapter, we defined two procedures \q{throw-one-die}
and \q{throw-two-dice} that returned the result of a single
experiment, i.e., a single throw of one or two dice. What if we
want to find the {\em expected} result, and we don't want to do the
calculations? One way, the so-called Monte Carlo method, is to
use iteration to
run the experiment many (e.g., 10000) times, and average the results.

\scmfilename montecarlo.scm

\scmdribble{
(define *num-trials* 10000)

(define monte-carlo
  (lambda (experiment)
    (let loop ((i 0) (acc 0.0))
      (if (= i *num-trials*)
          (/ acc *num-trials*)
          (loop (+ i 1) (+ acc (experiment)))))))
}

\n Now run

\q{
(monte-carlo throw-one-die)  |evalsto 3.4728
(monte-carlo throw-two-dice) |evalsto 6.9994
}

\n The expected values should be close to 3.5 and 7 respectively.

For some numerical-calculus examples of recursion (including iteration),

\section{Mapping a procedure across a list}

A special kind of iteration involves repeating the same
action for each element of a list.  Scheme offers two
procedures for this situation: \q{map} and \q{for-each}.

The \q{map} procedure applies a given procedure to every
element of a given list, and returns the list of the
results.  E.g.,

\q{
(map add2 '(1 2 3))
|evalsto (3 4 5)
}

The \q{for-each} procedure also applies a procedure to each
element in a list, but returns void.  The procedure
application is done purely for any side-effects it may
cause.  E.g.,

\q{
(for-each display
  (list "one " "two " "buckle my shoe"))
}

\n has the side-effect of displaying the strings (in
  the order they appear) on the console.

The procedures applied by \q{map} and \q{for-each}
need not be one-argument procedures.  For example,
given an \q{n}-argument procedure, \q{map}
takes \q{n} lists and applies the procedure to
every set of \q{n} of arguments selected from across
the lists.  E.g.,

\q{
(map cons '(1 2 3) '(10 20 30))
|evalsto ((1 . 10) (2 . 20) (3 . 30))

(map + '(1 2 3) '(10 20 30))
|evalsto (11 22 33)
}
