\chapter{I/O}

\index{port}
Scheme has input/output (I/O) procedures that will let you
read from an input port or write to an output port.  Ports
can be associated with the console, files or strings.

\section{Reading}

Scheme’s reader procedures take an optional input port
argument.  If the port is not specified, the current input
port (usually the console) is assumed.

\index{eof-object?@\q{eof-object?}}

Reading can be character-, line- or s-expression-based.
Each time a read is performed, the port’s state changes so
that the next read will read material following what was
already read.  If the port has no more material to be read,
the reader procedure returns a specific datum called the
end-of-file or eof object.  This datum is the only value
that satisfies the \q{eof-object?} predicate.

\index{read-char@\q{read-char}}
\index{read-line@\q{read-line}}
\index{read@\q{read}}

The procedure \q{read-char} reads the next character from
the port.  \q{read-line} reads the next line, returning it
as a string (the final newline is not included).  The
procedure \q{read} reads the next s-expression.

\section{Writing}

Scheme’s writer procedures take the object that is to be
written and an optional output port argument.  If the port
is not specified, the current output port (usually the
console) is assumed.

Writing can be character- or s-expression-based.

\index{write-char@\q{write-char}}

The procedure \q{write-char} writes the given character
(without the \p{#\}) to the output port.

\index{write@\q{write}}
\index{display@\q{display}}
\index{newline@\q{newline}}

The procedures \q{write} and \q{display} both
write the given s-expression to the port, with one
difference: \q{write} attempts to use a machine-readable
format and \q{display} doesn’t.  E.g., \q{write} uses double
quotes for strings and the \p{#\} syntax for characters.
\q{display} doesn’t.

The procedure \q{newline} starts a new line on 
the output port.

\section{File ports}

\index{current-input-port@\q{current-input-port}}
\index{current-output-port@\q{current-output-port}}
\index{standard input}
\index{standard output}
Scheme’s I/O procedures do not need a port argument if the
port happens to be standard input or standard output.
However, if you need these ports explicitly, the
zero-argument procedures \q{current-input-port} and
\q{current-output-port} furnish them.  Thus,

\q{
(display 9)
(display 9 (current-output-port))
}

\n have the same behavior.

\index{open-input-file@\q{open-input-file}}
\index{open-output-file@\q{open-output-file}}

A port is associated with a file by {\em opening} the file.
The procedure \q{open-input-file} takes a filename argument
and returns a new input port associated with it.  The
procedure \q{open-output-file} takes a filename argument and
returns a new output port associated with it.  It is an
error to open an input file that doesn’t exist, or to open
an output file that already exists.

\index{close-input-port@\q{close-input-port}}
\index{close-output-port@\q{close-output-port}}

After you have performed I/O on a port, you should close it
with \q{close-input-port} or \q{close-output-port}.

In the following, assume the file \p{hello.txt} contains the
single word \q{hello}.  

\q{
(define i (open-input-file "hello.txt"))

(read-char i)
|evalsto #\h

(define j (read i))

j
|evalsto ello
}

Assume the file \p{greeting.txt} does not exist before the
following programs are fed to the listener:

\q{
(define o (open-output-file "greeting.txt"))

(display "hello" o)
(write-char #\space o)
(display 'world o)
(newline o)

(close-output-port o)
}

\n The file \p{greeting.txt} will now contain the
line:

\p{
hello world
}

\subsection{Automatic opening and closing of file ports}

\index{call-with-input-file@\q{call-with-input-file}}
\index{call-with-output-file@\q{call-with-output-file}}
Scheme supplies the procedures \q{call-with-input-file} and
\q{call-with-output-file} that will take care of opening a
port and closing it after you’re done with it.

The procedure \q{call-with-input-file} takes a filename
argument and a procedure.  The procedure is applied to an
input port opened on the file.  When the procedure
completes, its result is returned after ensuring that the
port is closed.

\q{
(call-with-input-file "hello.txt"
  (lambda (i)
    (let* ((a (read-char i))
           (b (read-char i))
           (c (read-char i)))
      (list a b c))))
|evalsto (#\h #\e #\l)
}

The procedure \q{call-with-output-file} does the analogous
services for an output file.


\index{string!port for}
\index{port!for string}

\section{String ports}

\index{open-input-string@\q{open-input-string}}
It is often convenient to associate ports with strings.
Thus, the procedure \q{open-input-string} associates a port
with a given string.  Reader procedures on this port will
read off the string:

\q{
(define i (open-input-string "hello world"))

(read-char i)
|evalsto #\h

(read i)
|evalsto ello

(read i)
|evalsto world
}

\index{open-output-string@\q{open-output-string}}

The procedure \q{open-output-string} creates an 
output port that will eventually be used to create a string:

\q{
(define o (open-output-string))

(write 'hello o)
(write-char #\, o)
(display " " o)
(display "world" o)
}

\index{get-output-string@\q{get-output-string}}

You can now use the procedure \q{get-output-string} to get
the accumulated string in the string port \q{o}:

\q{
(get-output-string o)
|evalsto "hello, world"
}

String ports need not be explicitly closed.

\index{file!loading}
\index{load@\q{load}}

\section{Loading files}

We have already seen the procedure \q{load} that loads
files containing Scheme code.  {\em Loading} a file
consists in evaluating in sequence every Scheme form in
the file.  The pathname argument given to \q{load} is
reckoned relative to the current working directory of
Scheme, which is normally the directory in which the
Scheme executable was called.

Files can load other files, and this is useful in a
large program spanning many files.  Unfortunately,
unless full pathnames are used, the argument file of a
\q{load} is dependent on Scheme’s current
directory.  Supplying full pathnames is not always
convenient, because we would like to move the program
files as a unit (preserving their relative pathnames),
perhaps to many different machines.  

\index{load-relative@\q{load-relative}}

MzScheme provides the \q{load-relative} procedure that
greatly helps in fixing the files to be loaded.
\q{load-relative}, like \q{load}, takes a pathname
argument.  When a \q{load-relative} call occurs in a
file \q{foo.scm}, the path of its argument is reckoned
from the directory of the calling file \q{foo.scm}.  In
particular, this pathname is reckoned independent of
Scheme’s current directory, and thus allows convenient
multifile program development.
