\chapter{Conditionals}

\index{if@\q{if}}
\index{conditional}
Like all languages, Scheme provides {\em
conditionals}.  The basic form is the \q{if}:

\q{
(if test-expression
    then-branch
  else-branch)
}

If \q{test-expression} evaluates to true (i.e., any value
other than \q{#f}), the “then” branch is evaluated.
If not, the “else” branch  is evaluated.  The
“else” branch  is optional.

\q{
(define p 80)

(if (> p 70) 
    'safe
  'unsafe)
|evalsto safe 

(if (< p 90)
    'low-pressure) ;no “else” branch 
|evalsto low-pressure 
}

Scheme provides some other conditional forms for
convenience.  They can all be defined as macros
(chapter~\ref{sugar}) that expand
into \q{if}-expressions.

\section{\q{when} and \q{unless}}

\q{when} and \q{unless} are convenient conditionals
to use when only one branch (the “then” or the
“else” branch) of the basic conditional is needed.

\q{
(when (< (pressure tube) 60)
   (open-valve tube)
   (attach floor-pump tube)
   (depress floor-pump 5)
   (detach floor-pump tube)
   (close-valve tube))
}

Assuming \q{pressure} of \q{tube} is less than
\q{60}, this conditional will attach \q{floor-pump} to
\q{tube} and \q{depress} it \q{5} times.  (\q{attach}
and \q{depress} are some suitable procedures.)

The same program using \q{if} would be:

\q{
(if (< (pressure tube) 60)
    (begin
      (open-valve tube)
      (attach floor-pump tube)
      (depress floor-pump 5)
      (detach floor-pump tube)
      (close-valve tube)))
}

\index{begin@\q{begin}!implicit}

Note that \q{when}’s branch is an implicit \q{begin},
whereas \q{if} requires an explicit \q{begin} if either
of its branches has more than one form.

The same behavior can be written using \q{unless} as
follows:

\q{
(unless (>= (pressure tube) 60)
   (open-valve tube)
   (attach floor-pump tube)
   (depress floor-pump 5)
   (detach floor-pump tube)
   (close-valve tube))
}

\n Not all Schemes provide \q{when} and \q{unless}.
If your Scheme does not have them, you can 
define them as macros (see chapter~\ref{sugar}).

\index{cond@\q{cond}}
\section{\q{cond}}

The \q{cond} form is convenient for expressing nested
\q{if}-expressions, where each “else” branch but the last
introduces a new \q{if}.  Thus, the form 

\q{
(if (char<? c #\c) -1
    (if (char=? c #\c) 0
        1))
}

can be rewritten using \q{cond} as:

\q{
(cond ((char<? c #\c) -1)
      ((char=? c #\c) 0)
      (else 1))
}

The \q{cond} is thus a {\em multi-branch} conditional.  Each
clause has a test and an associated action.  The first
test that succeeds triggers its associated action.  The
final \q{else} clause is chosen if no other test
succeeded.

The \q{cond} actions are implicit \q{begin}s.

\index{case@\q{case}}
\section{\q{case}}

A special case of the \q{cond} can be compressed into a
\q{case} expression.  This is when every test is a
membership test.

\q{
(case c
  ((#\a) 1)
  ((#\b) 2)
  ((#\c) 3)
  (else 4))
|evalsto 3
}

The clause whose head contains the value of \q{c} is chosen.

\index{and@\q{and}}
\index{or@\q{or}}
\section{\q{and} and \q{or}}

Scheme provides special forms for boolean conjunction
(“and”) and disjunction (“or”).  (We have already
seen (section~\ref{booleans}) Scheme’s boolean negation
\q{not}, which is a 
procedure.) 

The special form
\q{and} returns a true value if all its subforms are true.  The
actual value returned is the value of the final
subform.  If any of the subforms are false, \q{and}
returns \q{#f}.

\q{
(and 1 2)  |evalsto 2
(and #f 1) |evalsto #f
}

\n The special form \q{or} returns the value of its
first true subform.  If all the subforms are false,
\q{or} returns \q{#f}.

\q{
(or 1 2)  |evalsto 1
(or #f 1) |evalsto 1
}

\n Both \q{and} and \q{or} evaluate their subforms
left-to-right.  As soon as the result can be
determined, \q{and} and \q{or} will ignore the
remaining subforms.

\q{
(and 1 #f expression-guaranteed-to-cause-error)
|evalsto #f

(or 1 #f expression-guaranteed-to-cause-error)
|evalsto 1
}
