One of the signal features of Scheme is its support for
jumps or {\em nonlocal control}.  Specifically, Scheme
allows program control to jump to {\em arbitrary}
locations in the program, in contrast to the more
restrained forms of program control flow allowed by
conditionals and procedure calls.  Scheme’s nonlocal
control operator is a procedure named
\q{call-with-current-continuation}.   We will
see how this operator can be used to create a
breathtaking variety of control idioms.

\section{\q{call-with-current-continuation}}

\index{call/cc@\q{call/cc}}
\index{continuation}
The operator \q{call-with-current-continuation} {\em
call}s its argument, which must be a unary procedure,
{\em with} a value called the “{\em current
continuation}”.  If nothing else, this explains the
name of the operator.  But it is a long name, and is
often abbreviated
\q{call/cc}.\f{If your Scheme does not already have this
abbreviation, include
\q{(define call/cc call-with-current-continuation)} in
your initialization code and protect yourself from
RSI.}

The current continuation at any point in the execution
of a program is an abstraction of the {\em rest of the
program}.  Thus in the program

\q{
(+ 1 (call/cc
       (lambda (k)
         (+ 2 (k 3)))))
}

\n
the rest of the program, from the point of view of the
\q{call/cc}-application, is the following
program-with-a-hole (with \q{[]} representing the
hole):

\q{
(+ 1 [])
}

\n
In other words, this continuation is a program that
will add \q{1} to whatever is used to fill its hole.

This is what the argument of \q{call/cc} is {\em called
with}.  Remember that the argument of \q{call/cc} is
the procedure

\q{
(lambda (k)
  (+ 2 (k 3)))
}

\n
This procedure’s body applies the continuation (bound
now to the parameter \q{k}) to the argument \q{3}.
This is when the unusual aspect of the continuation
springs to the fore.  The continuation call abruptly
abandons its own computation and replaces it with the
rest of the program saved in \q{k}!  In other words,
the part of the procedure involving the addition of
\q{2} is jettisoned, and \q{k}’s argument \q{3} is sent
directly to the program-with-the-hole:

\q{
(+ 1 [])
}

\n
The program now running is simply

\q{
(+ 1 3)
}

\n
which returns \q{4}.  In sum,

\q{
(+ 1 (call/cc
       (lambda (k)
         (+ 2 (k 3)))))
|evalsto 4
}

\n
The above illustrates what is called an {\em
escaping} continuation, one used to exit out of a
computation (here: the \q{(+ 2 [])} computation).  This
is a useful property, but Scheme’s continuations can
also be used to return to previously abandoned
contexts, and indeed to invoke them many times.  The
“rest of the program” enshrined in a continuation is
available whenever and how many ever times we choose to
recall it, and this is what contributes to the great
and sometimes confusing versatility of \q{call/cc}.  As
a quick example, type the following at the listener:

\q{
(define r #f)

(+ 1 (call/cc
       (lambda (k)
         (set! r k)
         (+ 2 (k 3)))))
|evalsto 4
}

\n
The latter expression returns \q{4} as before.  The
difference between this use of \q{call/cc} and the
previous example is that here we also store the
continuation \q{k} in a global variable \q{r}.

Now we have a permanent record of the continuation in
\q{r}.  If we call it on a number, it will return that
number incremented by \q{1}:

\q{
(r 5)
|evalsto 6
}

\n
Note that \q{r} will abandon its own continuation,
which is better illustrated by embedding the call to
\q{r} inside some context:

\q{
(+ 3 (r 5))
|evalsto 6
}

\n
The continuations provided by \q{call/cc} are thus
{\em abortive} continuations.

\section{Escaping continuations}

Escaping continuations are the simplest use of
\q{call/cc} and are very useful for programming
procedure or loop exits.  Consider a procedure
\q{list-product} that takes a list of numbers and
multiplies them.  A straightforward recursive
definition for \q{list-product} is:

\scmfilename listprod-fun.scm

\scmdribble{
(define list-product
  (lambda (s)
    (let recur ((s s))
      (if (null? s) 1
          (* (car s) (recur (cdr s)))))))
}

\n
There is a problem with this solution.  If one of the
elements in the list is \q{0}, and if there are many
elements after \q{0} in the list, then the answer is a
foregone conclusion.  Yet, the code will have us go
through many fruitless recursive calls to \q{recur}
before producing the answer.  This is where an escape
continuation comes in handy.  Using \q{call/cc}, we can
rewrite the procedure as:

\scmfilename listprod-cwcc.scm

\scmdribble{
(define list-product
  (lambda (s)
    (call/cc
      (lambda (exit)
        (let recur ((s s))
          (if (null? s) 1
              (if (= (car s) 0) (exit 0)
                  (* (car s) (recur (cdr s))))))))))
}

\n
If a \q{0} element is encountered, the continuation
\q{exit} is called with \q{0}, thereby avoiding
further calls to \q{recur}.

\section{Tree matching}

A more involved example of continuation usage is the
problem of determining if two trees (arbitrarily nested
dotted pairs) have the same {\em fringe}, i.e., the
same elements (or {\em leaves}) in the same sequence.
E.g.,

\q{
(same-fringe? '(1 (2 3)) '((1 2) 3))
|evalsto #t

(same-fringe? '(1 2 3) '(1 (3 2)))
|evalsto #f
}

The purely functional approach is to flatten both trees
and check if the results match.

\scmfilename fringe-fun.scm

\scmdribble{
(define same-fringe?
  (lambda (tree1 tree2)
    (let loop ((ftree1 (flatten tree1))
               (ftree2 (flatten tree2)))
      (cond ((and (null? ftree1) (null? ftree2)) #t)
            ((or (null? ftree1) (null? ftree2)) #f)
            ((eqv? (car ftree1) (car ftree2))
             (loop (cdr ftree1) (cdr ftree2)))
            (else #f)))))

(define flatten
  (lambda (tree)
    (cond ((null? tree) '())
          ((pair? (car tree))
           (append (flatten (car tree))
                   (flatten (cdr tree))))
          (else
           (cons (car tree)
                 (flatten (cdr tree)))))))
}

\n
However, this traverses the trees completely to flatten
them, and then again till it finds non-matching
elements.  Furthermore, even the best flattening
algorithms will require \q{cons}es equal to the total
number of leaves.  (Destructively modifying the input
trees is not an option.)

We can use \q{call/cc} to solve the problem without
needless traversal and without any \q{cons}ing.  Each
tree is mapped to a {\em generator}, a procedure with
internal state that successively produces the leaves of
the tree in the left-to-right order that they occur in
the tree.

\scmfilename fringe-cwcc.scm

\scmdribble{
(define tree->generator
  (lambda (tree)
    (let ((caller '*))
      (letrec
          ((generate-leaves
            (lambda ()
              (let loop ((tree tree))
                (cond ((null? tree) 'skip)
                      ((pair? tree)
                       (loop (car tree))
                       (loop (cdr tree)))
                      (else
                       (call/cc
                        (lambda (rest-of-tree)
                          (set! generate-leaves
                            (lambda ()
                              (rest-of-tree 'resume)))
                          (caller tree))))))
              (caller '()))))
        (lambda ()
          (call/cc
           (lambda (k)
             (set! caller k)
             (generate-leaves))))))))
}

\n
When a generator created by \q{tree->generator} is
called, it will store the continuation of its call in
\q{caller}, so that it can know who to send the leaf to
when it finds it.  It then calls an internal procedure
called \q{generate-leaves} which runs a loop traversing
the tree from left to right.  When the loop encounters
a leaf, it will use \q{caller} to return the leaf as
the generator’s result, but it will remember to store
the rest of the loop (captured as a \q{call/cc}
continuation) in the \q{generate-leaves} variable.  The
next time the generator is called, the loop is resumed
where it left off so it can hunt for the next leaf.

Note that the last thing \q{generate-leaves} does,
after the loop is done, is to return the empty list to
the
\q{caller}.  Since the empty list is not a valid leaf
value, we can use it to tell that the generator has
no more leaves to generate.

The procedure \q{same-fringe?} maps each of its tree
arguments to a generator, and then calls these two
generators alternately.  It announces failure as soon
as two non-matching leaves are found:

\scmdribble{
(define same-fringe?
  (lambda (tree1 tree2)
    (let ((gen1 (tree->generator tree1))
          (gen2 (tree->generator tree2)))
      (let loop ()
        (let ((leaf1 (gen1))
              (leaf2 (gen2)))
          (if (eqv? leaf1 leaf2)
              (if (null? leaf1) #t (loop))
              #f))))))
}

\n
It is easy to see that the trees are traversed at most
once, and in case of mismatch, the traversals extend
only upto the leftmost mismatch.  \q{cons} is not used.

\index{coroutine}
\index{call/cc@\q{call/cc}!and coroutine}

\section{Coroutines}

The generators used above are interesting
generalizations of the procedure concept.  Each time
the generator is called, it resumes its computation,
and when it has a result for its caller returns it, but
only after storing its continuation in an internal
variable so the generator can be resumed again.  We can
generalize generators further, so that they can
mutually resume each other, sending results back and
forth amongst themselves.  Such procedures are called
{\em coroutines}~\cite{coroutine}.

We will view a coroutine as a unary procedure, whose
body can contain \q{resume} calls.  \q{resume} is a
two-argument procedure used by a coroutine to resume
another coroutine with a transfer value.  The macro \q{coroutine}
defines such a coroutine procedure, given a variable name for
the coroutine’s initial argument, and the body of the coroutine.

\scmfilename coroutine.scm

\scmdribble{
(define-macro coroutine
  (lambda (x . body)
    `(letrec ((+local-control-state
               (lambda (,x) ,@body))
              (resume
               (lambda (c v)
                 (call/cc
                  (lambda (k)
                    (set! +local-control-state k)
                    (c v))))))
       (lambda (v)
         (+local-control-state v)))))
}

\n A call of this macro creates a coroutine procedure
(let’s call it $A$) that can be called with one
argument.  $A$ has an internal variable called
\q{+local-control-state} that stores, at any point, the
remaining computation of the coroutine.   Initially
this is the entire coroutine computation.  When
\q{resume} is called — i.e., invoking another coroutine
$B$ — the current coroutine will update its
\q{+local-control-state} value to the rest of itself,
stop itself, and then jump to the \q{resume}d coroutine
$B$.  When coroutine $A$ is itself \q{resume}d at
some later point, its computation will proceed from the
continuation stored in its \q{+local-control-state}.

\scmfilename fringe-cor.scm

\subsection{Tree-matching with coroutines}

Tree-matching is further simplified using coroutines.
The matching process is coded as a coroutine that
depends on two other coroutines to supply the leaves of
the respective trees:

\scmdribble{
(define make-matcher-cor
  (lambda (tree-cor-1 tree-cor-2)
    (coroutine dummy-init-arg
      (let loop ()
        (let ((leaf1 (resume tree-cor-1 'get-a-leaf))
              (leaf2 (resume tree-cor-2 'get-a-leaf)))
          (if (eqv? leaf1 leaf2)
              (if (null? leaf1) #t (loop))
              #f))))))
}

\n
The leaf-generator coroutines remember who to send
their leaves to:

\scmdribble{
(define make-leaf-gen-cor
  (lambda (tree matcher-cor)
    (coroutine dummy-init-arg
      (let loop ((tree tree))
        (cond ((null? tree) 'skip)
              ((pair? tree)
               (loop (car tree))
               (loop (cdr tree)))
              (else
               (resume matcher-cor tree))))
      (resume matcher-cor '()))))
}

\n
The \q{same-fringe?} procedure can now {\em almost}
be written as

\q{
(define same-fringe?
  (lambda (tree1 tree2)
    (letrec ((tree-cor-1
              (make-leaf-gen-cor
               tree1
               matcher-cor))
             (tree-cor-2
              (make-leaf-gen-cor
               tree2
               matcher-cor))
             (matcher-cor
              (make-matcher-cor
               tree-cor-1
               tree-cor-2)))
      (matcher-cor 'start-the-ball-rolling))))
}

\n
Unfortunately, Scheme’s \q{letrec} can resolve
mutually recursive references amongst the lexical
variables it introduces {\em only} if such variable
references are wrapped inside a \q{lambda}.  And so we
write:

\scmdribble{
(define same-fringe?
  (lambda (tree1 tree2)
    (letrec ((tree-cor-1
              (make-leaf-gen-cor
               tree1
               (lambda (v) (matcher-cor v))))
             (tree-cor-2
              (make-leaf-gen-cor
               tree2
               (lambda (v) (matcher-cor v))))
             (matcher-cor
              (make-matcher-cor
               (lambda (v) (tree-cor-1 v))
               (lambda (v) (tree-cor-2 v)))))
      (matcher-cor 'start-the-ball-rolling))))
}

\n
Note that \q{call/cc} is not called directly at all in
this rewrite of \q{same-fringe?}.  All the continuation
manipulation is handled for us by the
\q{coroutine} macro.
